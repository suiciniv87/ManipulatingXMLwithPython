# ManipulatingXMLwithPython

I needed manipulate some XML for IA, but folder, filename and path was wrong, so I did it to correct.

So, you can manipulate how you need. (Like you can see, I did it with 999 files, so file = str(filename[:3]) works for me, if you use more, change it.

For run it: python ManipulatingXMLwithPython.py
